The Coffee Shop project journey began on Miro, where a detailed project map was created to visualise the data flow and analytical process. This map outlined the data sources, ETL stages, Snowflake storage, and final reporting outputs. Using Miro helped structure the project, define objectives, assign responsibilities, and ensure clear communication across stakeholders before data work began.

Next, the focus shifted to data extraction and analysis in Snowflake. Through SQL queries, the analyst cleaned, joined, and transformed data from multiple tables to build a unified dataset. Key tasks included filtering, aggregating, and validating data accuracy. SQL scripts were versioned and stored on GitHub, ensuring collaboration, traceability, and version control throughout the analysis phase.

After the Snowflake analysis, the refined dataset was exported to Excel for exploratory analysis. Pivot tables were used to summarise metrics, identify patterns, and generate quick insights such as sales trends, product performance, and customer segments. Data validation and formatting ensured clarity and consistency for reporting.

Finally, insights were transformed into compelling visuals and narratives in PowerPoint (PPT). Charts, dashboards, and key findings were presented with a focus on business implications and actionable recommendations. The presentation connected the technical analysis to strategic outcomes, making it clear for decision-makers.
